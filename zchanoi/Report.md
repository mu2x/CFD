## Modeling of Solution Combustion Synthesis 
### Abstract 
There is a need to understand the effect of synthesis parameters over the size, morphology, and composition of the nanostructured materials. Currently, there has been very little progress in the mechanistic studies and systematic modelling to gain insight into the dynamics of the SCS process both in the gas phase and the solid phase. There is a lack of methodology to control not only the size within the nanometer and micrometer scales, but also the shapes of various geometries for nanostructured materials. An in-depth understanding of the controllability and flexibility of these factors would lead to further advances in the control of the morphology of nanomaterials. This particular challenge can be met through the combination of developing new synthetic approaches to control the exothermicity of the combustion reaction and in-situ advanced analytical techniques to monitor the combustion reaction under real operation time.
