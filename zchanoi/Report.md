## 2D Finite Volume Method for Multi-Material Selective Laser SinteringÂ¶
### Abstract 
Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is an Additive Manufacturing (AM) technique that sinters material powders together using a laser in a heated enclosure. Typically, SLS printing of thermoplastic polymers is done with one material. Technology advances have introduced the possibility of multi-material (M2) SLS printing involving more than one different thermoplastics being sintered in one print. M2 AM is an attractive domain of AM because of the potential to create highly-customizable mechanically-tailored structures for many industries. However, differences in thermal properties between materals result in frequent print errors which create weakness in printed structures or aborted prints. This beckons a better understanding of the thermal mechanisms of the M2 SLS printing process. This report presents the preliminary calculations and modeling of a 2-dimensional (2D) M2 SLS print using finite volume method (FVM).
